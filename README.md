# TweetX
TweetX is a responsive, Twitter-inspired modern UI clone built using HTML and TailwindCSS. It recreates the look and feel of Twitter’s web interface, including a sidebar menu, main feed, post composer, and trending section. This project is a front-end design exercise — it focuses purely on UI/UX without backend functionality.
