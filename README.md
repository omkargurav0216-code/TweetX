## TweetX — Twitter UI Clone

## Description
TweetX is a responsive, Twitter-inspired modern UI clone built using **HTML** and **TailwindCSS**.
It recreates the look and feel of Twitter’s web interface, including a sidebar menu, main feed, post composer, and trending section. This project is a front-end design exercise — it focuses purely on **UI/UX** without backend functionality.

TweetX is ideal for practicing **responsive web design, TailwindCSS utility classes**, and **semantic HTML structuring**.
